#' xiangqi: utilities to analyze and archive xiangqi games
#'
#' The xiangqi package is a set of tool that makes the life of a xiangqi player
#' easier. Xiangqi is a chess-variant popular in Asia, and is by player-base arguably
#' the most popular board game in the world. However, language barriers, availability
#' of materials and closed-circuit software and databases obfuscate the learning and
#' playing process.
#'
#' A core consideration of the package is that each user has a preference for
#' a managing their own balance between ease-of-use and adaptability. For this reason
#' the functions are chopped up in bite-size parts, each following a logical process
#' in the analysis process.
